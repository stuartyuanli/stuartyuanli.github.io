<section class="content">
    <p>I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mining Engineering at the University of Utah. I earned my PhD in Mining Engineering from the University of British Columbia, where I studied under the supervision of Professor Dirk van Zyl. My research focuses on advancing mine tailings management, with a particular emphasis on dewatering methods through sedimentation and filtration techniques.</p>
    
    <p>I also explore the rheological properties, mechanical behavior, and geotechnical characteristics of various types of tailings. In the management of tailings storage facilities (TSFs), my work addresses key safety challenges and the environmental impact of tailings. Additionally, I am interested in the potential of utilizing tailings for carbon capture and storage, investigating their role in CO2 sequestration.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond academia, I have industry experience working with consulting firms such as SRK, HATCH, and AECOM, where I was involved in geotechnical field investigations, tailings dam design, and stability analysis.</p>
